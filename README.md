# Inflection-Point-Diffraction
The code is all intended for use in Matlab. The codes I have written are the files:
InflectionFD/Popov_FD.m (Used for solving of Popov's finite difference scheme on a domain in (x,t) space, generalised to control FD method with parameter theta)
InflectionFD/Popov_FD_Simplified.m (Same as above but theta=1/2, which allows for easier construction of matrices used and therefore simpler and faster code at the cost of generality)
InflectionFD/Popov_FD_Backup.m (Not useful, use an above version instead)
InflectionFD/Initial_condition_comparison.m (Used to analyse errors in the different orders of approximation for the initial conditions on t=t_0)
InflectionFD/varyt0.m (Used to analyse the errors in the searchlight as t_0 varies)
InflectionFD/varyh.m (Used to analyse the errors in the searchlight as x-stepsize h varies)
InflectionFD/varytau (Used to analyse the errors in the searchlight as t-stepsize tau varies)
InflectionFD/TridiagMatMul.m (Used to pre-mutiply a vector by a sparse matrix of specific form used in the FD algorithm)
InflectionFD/TridiagMatSolve.m (Used to solve a system of the system Ax=b where A has a specific form in the FD algorithm)

Lots of images were generated by me and used in the final project submission.
